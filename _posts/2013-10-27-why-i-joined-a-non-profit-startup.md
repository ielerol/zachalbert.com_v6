A designer whose name I can&#8217;t remember said this, and it stuck with me even if their name didn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s an excellent summary of my current attitude towards tech work. Doing something primarily for other people isn&#8217;t a requirement for everybody, but I&#8217;ve found that I&#8217;m much happier when I&#8217;m using my skills to improve the lives of people who don&#8217;t have it as easy as I do. I&#8217;ve discovered that anywhere I go, there are always politics, stress, and difficult personalities to deal with. In exchange for all that stress, I wanted more than just a paycheck. I wanted to contribute to a movement that changes lives.
