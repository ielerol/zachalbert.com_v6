## A few months ago, I left my job at Recurly to join a non-profit startup. Why did I leave the stability of a well-paid tech startup job?

> &ldquo;Anything done purely for yourself empties very quickly.&rdquo;

A designer whose name I can&#8217;t remember said this, and it stuck with me even if their name didn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s an excellent summary of my current attitude towards tech work. Doing something primarily for other people isn&#8217;t a requirement for everybody, but I&#8217;ve found that I&#8217;m much happier when I&#8217;m using my skills to improve the lives of people who don&#8217;t have it as easy as I do. I&#8217;ve discovered that anywhere I go, there are always politics, stress, and difficult personalities to deal with. In exchange for all that stress, I wanted more than just a paycheck. I wanted to contribute to a movement that changes lives.

Check out my new organization: [Samahope — crowdfunding critical medical treatments for the world&#8217;s poorest][1].

### How you can help

Joining a non-profit full time is a big commitment, but there are many other low-bar ways to help out. Non-profits typically need some serious help on the design / engineering side, and giving an organization one of your Saturdays can help them save hundreds of dollars, not to mention help further their cause.
