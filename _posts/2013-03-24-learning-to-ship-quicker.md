## The redesign of this site has been a really long time coming. What I mean by that is I&#8217;ve been stalling for *over a year*. I&#8217;ve been learning to ship quicker however, and I&#8217;m going to share a bit about what inspired me.

For context, I&#8217;ve been building websites since I was 13. I can crank out a site like this in a few weeks for a client. Yet I found myself in this ridiculous (and counter-productive) feedback loop that oscillated between &#8220;I really need to get this done,&#8221; and &#8220;Why the hell isn&#8217;t it done yet?&#8221; I wasn&#8217;t even just working slowly, I was completely stalled. Learning about [Lean UX][1] and outcome-centric thinking is what helped me learn to ship quicker, and I want to share some of those resources.

Yeah&#8230;

I&#8217;m not sure why I&#8217;m so susceptible to procrastinating on my own projects, but it&#8217;s a nasty little mental block. Before I mention what changed for me, it&#8217;s important to note that I still really suck at it — I&#8217;m just getting better.

The first thing that changed was simply recognizing how badly I was procrastinating. Nothing like keeping tabs on the [popular shots on Dribbble][2] to make you feel like a slacker. Keep that crap to a minimum though, lest you start to equate popularity on Dribbble with success at solving real world problems for non-designer people (which is hopefully why you&#8217;re doing design).

The second — and biggest — thing that changed was [getting inspired][3] to build things by other people who have learned to ship quickly.

### Learn to Focus on Outcomes

I spend my daylight hours building web apps with a rapid-fire, [Lean UX][1] approach. Lean UX preaches rapid prototyping, iteration, and customer validation. The tough part is that customer validation in this context means getting approval from the worst client *ever *— yourself. Part of being a good designer means staying thirsty to improve things around you, and we tend to apply this philosophy most ruthlessly to our own projects. This is actually a great thing as long as we can stay focused on **outcomes** instead of **outputs**. A plainer way to state that is to figure out what your end goal is, and drive at it uncompromisingly.

I knew that in order to implement this perspective shift, I needed to do something drastically different. Inspired by [Drew Wilson][4] and [Josh Long][5], who wrote [a book about rapid execution][6] in 8 days (naturally), I shifted into survival mode.<figure class="card wp-caption alignnoneid="attachment\_68" aria-labelledby="figcaption\_attachment_68">

Survival mode forces a rapid realignment of priorities. Everything that isn&#8217;t directly related to survival is ignored, freeing up all your resources to pursue what&#8217;s important. What&#8217;s important in this case are the **outcomes** you hope to achieve.

Outcomes are reasonable things, completely separate from deliverables. &#8220;I want to launch my website redesign&#8221; is an **output**. This type of thinking will lead to disappointment and procrastination, because it&#8217;s hard to tell what success looks like. An outcome-centric way to modify that statement might be &#8220;I want to share what I&#8217;m learning about doing UX design for startups with my design colleagues and startup founders.&#8221;

Notice there&#8217;s no implementation assumptions in that last statement. It could be a website redesign, but doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to be. Once I shifted into survival mode, asking questions in the right way helped me figure out what I should cut from the scope and what I should keep. The best way to get comfortable with this barebones approach is to make sure to log every idea and bug somewhere permanent (some people use their brains — I use [Trello][7] and [Evernote][8]).**

### Why You Should Care

So why is it so important to learn how to ship quickly? This is so obvious it hardly bears repeating, but here it is anyway: *The web is a continuously evolving medium.* There is an impermanence to it like nothing else, and the act of contributing changes it forever. [Frank Chimero][9] sums up what it means to work in the world of web & design better than anyone else:

> &#8220;Culture changes what it expects from design after design changes culture.&#8221;<cite>(<em>from </em><a href="http://www.shapeofdesignbook.com/chapter06.html">The Shape of Design, <em>chapter 6</em></a>).</cite>

In other words, you know that awesome thing you&#8217;ve been building for the last year? Well&#8230; it&#8217;s already [4.7 internet years out of date][10].

The hardest part about all this is knowing exactly *what* to cut, and *when it&#8217;s appropriate* to do so. This takes practice, but outcome-centric thinking *really* helps.

### Case Study

I&#8217;m going to wrap this rambly post up with a brief case study on the decisions I made for this very site. I had two main outcomes: (1) to practice shipping before I&#8217;m completely comfortable, and (2) to make the lessons I learn publicly available, since reading [the accounts of others][11] is what inspired me.

  1. **“I haven&#8217;t finished my custom portfolio yet.”  
    **I decided that I didn&#8217;t need to launch with my portfolio. This was the hardest decision, because this site has traditionally *only* served as my online portfolio. But I do have [my Dribbble feed auto-blogging to my wordpress site][12], which completely *accomplishes the goal* of showing my work. When I refocused on outcomes, I realized how silly it was to hold up launch to do version 2.0 of a feature (when nobody has even seen version 1.0 yet).  
    **Lesson Learned**: *Don&#8217;t get attached to outputs, get attached to solving the problem at hand.*
  2. **“The footer sucks, and I don&#8217;t have a contact form”**  
    Re: the footer — who cares?  
    Re: contact form — how many people still use contact forms? I&#8217;ve placed prominent links to my various online profiles at the top of the page. These methods might not be quite as convenient, but they still allow communication to occur.  
    **Lesson Learned**: *Think in terms of short-term and long-term solutions. If a short-term solution allows you to ship sooner, then it&#8217;s probably worth it.*
  3. **“IT&#8217;S NOT COMPLETELY RESPONSIVE!!!1”**  
    This one always gives me a good chuckle. You wouldn&#8217;t believe the amount of time I wasted trying to design responsive hi-fi mockups in my drug of choice — Illustrator. It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t love RWD and think it&#8217;s fun, but I&#8217;m just one lonely perfectionist trying to launch a website with a few spare hours each week, and it was really getting in the way of shipping quickly. Plus, I can always add responsive support later. Sorry, mobilites.  
    **Lessons Learned**: *An unshipped product isn&#8217;t a product at all. A so-so experience is better than no experience.*
  4. **“The design is outdated and lacks polish”**  
    This is another tough one for me, as it&#8217;s an easy trap to fall into. This design already feels outdated to me because it&#8217;s been locked up in the lab for so long. Going back to point #1 — don&#8217;t get attached to outputs. My objectives are to practice shipping, and to share my learning — and the level of design polish isn&#8217;t standing in the way of that.  
    **Lesson Learned**: *Focus on what matters. Stay true to the outcomes you set out to achieve.*
