The redesign of this site has been a really long time coming. What I mean by that is I&#8217;ve been stalling for *over a year*. I&#8217;ve been learning to ship quicker however, and I&#8217;m going to share a bit about what inspired me.

For context, I&#8217;ve been building websites since I was 13. I can crank out a site like this in a few weeks for a client. Yet I found myself in this ridiculous (and counter-productive) feedback loop that oscillated between &#8220;I really need to get this done,&#8221; and &#8220;Why the hell isn&#8217;t it done yet?&#8221; I wasn&#8217;t even just working slowly, I was completely stalled. Learning about [Lean UX][1] and outcome-centric thinking is what helped me learn to ship quicker, and I want to share some of those resources.

Yeah&#8230;

I&#8217;m not sure why I&#8217;m so susceptible to procrastinating on my own projects, but it&#8217;s a nasty little mental block. Before I mention what changed for me, it&#8217;s important to note that I still really suck at it — I&#8217;m just getting better.

The first thing that changed was simply recognizing how badly I was procrastinating. Nothing like keeping tabs on the [popular shots on Dribbble][2] to make you feel like a slacker. Keep that crap to a minimum though, lest you start to equate popularity on Dribbble with success at solving real world problems for non-designer people (which is hopefully why you&#8217;re doing design).

The second — and biggest — thing that changed was [getting inspired][3] to build things by other people who have learned to ship quickly.

## Learn to Focus on Outcomes

I spend my daylight hours building web apps with a rapid-fire, [Lean UX][1] approach. Lean UX preaches rapid prototyping, iteration, and customer validation. The tough part is that customer validation in this context means getting approval from the worst client *ever *— yourself. Part of being a good designer means staying thirsty to improve things around you, and we tend to apply this philosophy most ruthlessly to our own projects. This is actually a great thing as long as we can stay focused on **outcomes** instead of **outputs**. A plainer way to state that is to figure out what your end goal is, and drive at it uncompromisingly.

I knew that in order to implement this perspective shift, I needed to do something drastically different. Inspired by [Drew Wilson][4] and [Josh Long][5], who wrote [a book about rapid execution][6] in 8 days (naturally), I shifted into survival mode.

Survival mode forces a rapid realignment of priorities. Everything that isn&#8217;t directly related to survival is ignored, freeing up all your resources to pursue what&#8217;s important. What&#8217;s important in this case are the **outcomes** you hope to achieve.

Outcomes are reasonable things, completely separate from deliverables. &#8220;I want to launch my website redesign&#8221; is an **output**. This type of thinking will lead to disappointment and procrastination, because it&#8217;s hard to tell what success looks like. An outcome-centric way to modify that statement might be &#8220;I want to share what I&#8217;m learning about doing UX design for startups with my design colleagues and startup founders.&#8221;

Notice there&#8217;s no implementation assumptions in that last statement. It could be a website redesign, but doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to be. Once I shifted into survival mode, asking questions in the right way helped me figure out what I should cut from the scope and what I should keep. The best way to get comfortable with this barebones approach is to make sure to log every idea and bug somewhere permanent (some people use their brains — I use [Trello][7] and [Evernote][8]).

### Why You Should Care

So why is it so important to learn how to ship quickly? This is so obvious it hardly bears repeating, but here it is anyway: *The web is a continuously evolving medium.* There is an impermanence to it like nothing else, and the act of contributing changes it forever. [Frank Chimero][9] sums up what it means to work in the world of web & design better than anyone else:

> &#8220;Culture changes what it expects from design after design changes culture.&#8221;<cite><em>Frank Chimero, from </em><a href="http://www.shapeofdesignbook.com/chapter06.html">The Shape of Design, chapter 6</a>.</cite>

In other words, you know that awesome thing you&#8217;ve been building for the last year? Well&#8230; it&#8217;s already [4.7 internet years out of date][10].

The hardest part about all this is knowing exactly *what* to cut, and *when it&#8217;s appropriate* to do so. This takes practice, but outcome-centric thinking *really* helps.
