## I gave a talk to the good people at Lean UX SF last night about the challenges UX people face moving their company cultures towards a collaborative design model.

I gave a case study from my work integrating collaborative design at Recurly (along with [Andy Montgomery][1]). The audience was nicer than they needed to be for my first public speaking engagement, as was the organizer [Mike Long][2] and host [Arseni Harkanou (at Ãœber Experience)][3].

What motivated the talk was curiosity about the stumbling blocks I was facing, and whether other UX people were facing similar challenges. I&#8217;m generally a reserved guy, and the new model for collaborative design requires strengths in leadership, influence, and persuasion. Basically, all the things they don&#8217;t teach you in design school.

I conducted a survey ([which you can still take here][4]) to analyze how difficult it was for UX people to implement collaborative design models over time, as well as the specific stumbling blocks they ran into. The TL;DR is that everyone finds collaborative design pretty difficult, and the most challenging aspects were things like entrenched waterfall culture, geographic separation, and changing people&#8217;s minds.

I&#8217;ll probably do a post in the future breaking down the results more thoroughly, because I love a good data viz. Here&#8217;s the slide deck from the presentation. (The bummer about slideshare is it doesn&#8217;t show animated gifs. To get the full effect of this first slide, look at [this first][5].)
