I had the opportunity to enter a logo contest for a UX group I've been attending. It's called <a href="http://sf.lean-ux.com/">Lean UX San Francisco</a> and is a sharp group of people focused on implementing lean thinking in their UX teams. There were a lot of great entries, but I'm proud to say my entry won.
