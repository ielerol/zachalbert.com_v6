If you're a designer, then you're responsible for making things that people use. If you're an artist, you (usually) have the luxury of making things that people just look at, talk about, and pay lots for. But design is fundamentally a pragmatic discipline.

If you're a human being alive in 2015, chances are you've spent some portion of your life using digital products. Products enable us to do _things_ which yield _feelings_ about our experience while doing the thing.

### Thinking in terms of "frustration minutes"

Of the field of possible feelings a user can have about using a product, they typically range from "really super effing frustrated" to "wow, that was really fun to use!"

If an app I use every day causes me one minute of frustration, then you might say that it causes me 30 frustration minutes per month.
