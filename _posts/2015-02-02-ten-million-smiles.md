If you're a designer, then you're responsible for making things that people use.

If you're a human being alive in 2015, then you spend some portion of your life using digital products. Products enable us to do _things_ which yield _feelings_ about our experiences. As a designer, this seemingly obvious observation can be a source of a great deal of anxiety. When I first realized it, I also realized that it meant I was uniquely _responsible_ the joys and frustrations my products generate in my users. Designers have the good fortune to work on teams of many capable people, but are often celebrated (and shamed) for good or bad "user experiences."

### Are you creating more smiles, or more frowns?

Recognizing the impact of design takes time, but it's a process worth internalizing. Are you responsible for creating more smiles, or more frowns? Are you responsible for experiences that make people curse the internet, or marvel at how magical and _uplifting_ it all seems? Do you even know what emotions you're responsible for? Do you _want to know?_

Despite the difficulty of learning how effective your design is for a target user, it's important to <a href="https://delighted.com/">measure it</a> and learn to relish the opportunity to learn something new about what people like and don't like.

## Thinking in terms of smiles and frowns

The biggest indicator of success for any product / design / engineering person I've ever met is when they consistently practice empathy for their customer. Empathy gets a lot of lip service, but user empathy is best thought of as a verb.

It's the act of learning about who uses your product, whether that product is responsible for smiles or frowns, and smoothing out the rough edges until there are more smiles than frowns.

## Practically speaking, NPS can help

The difficulty in putting a lot of this into practice is that a lof "user delight" is so subjective. Just because it's subjective, however, doesn't mean it can't be measured.

Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a 1-10 rating of how likely a customer would be to recommend a product to a friend. Mentioned earlier, <a href="https://delighted.com/">Delighted App</a> is an automated way of surveying your customers for this information. A 9 or a 10 is considered a promoter, a 7 or 8 would be passive, and a 6 or below would be a detractor.

While this system is rigid and a bit cheesy, it does give us a way to gauge relative emotional reaction to our products and surface how much of that positive emotion is "action-oriented" (meaning, likely to result in a referral).

The interesting side effect is that the NPS survey process aligns the goals of management with those of design. When a designer creates a great product experience, the business wins and the customer is happy. It creates incentive to continue investing and iterating on the user experience of the product.

While gathering your product's NPS score might seem tedious, I'd argue that doing it &mdash; or something like it &mdash; is the only way to  demonstrate true empathy for your user. Two-way communication is the responsibility of the designer to establish (if there isn't anyone to help inside your org). NPS isn't the only way, but it is relatively pain-free.
