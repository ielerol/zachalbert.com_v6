A few weeks ago, I participated in my first hackathon for <a href="https://refunite.org/">Refugees United</a> (supported by Ericsson). This organization “&#8230;aims to directly help families reconnect with missing loved ones through a safe, secure search tool that allows for full anonymity and is free of charge.”

Refugees United is doing awesome work and has already reconnected more refugee families this year than the entire Red Cross averages over a full year. I love seeing the use of technology to solve very real problems that shouldn&#8217;t exist, but do. Not that the next big Twitter or Facebook isn&#8217;t fun to think about, but siblings, children, and parents are being separated from each other in war-torn areas of our world—never to be reunited in many cases. [Read the story][2] that led brothers David and Christopher Mikkelsen to try to change all that.

### The Problem

The hackathon was structured around solving some of the problems the organization hasn&#8217;t had the time to solve yet. My team tackled the problem of the user-to-user messaging system.

The Refugees United team has figured out that nearly every person on the planet has access to some type of phone, even if that&#8217;s an old, basic feature phone. These phones aren&#8217;t always equipped with the capability to handle Internet or even SMS, but all have access to the USSD protocol—which is the protocol you use when you add minutes to your phone. The Refugees United platform takes advantage of USSD&#8217;s ubiquity and provides a way for refugees to register, search for, and message other refugees.

The problem with this protocol is that it has a three-minute timeout, and it can be difficult for refugees (some of whom are illiterate) to send a message to another potential family member with enough content to be useful—all in under three minutes.

### Our Solution

My team (Ivy Wang and Anari Sengbe, with some generous help from Kasper Cristjansen) developed a concept for a message wizard system. The wizard prompted users for answers in order to fill out an information rich message template, all while keeping the connection alive. Our team&#8217;s hypothesis is that by improving the user experience of the messaging system and standardizing the format,  more refugee connections can be made (and fewer missed).

### Conclusion

Our team&#8217;s project won the hackathon! There were 2 other winners from Nairobi and Cairo. There was awesome work done all around, but part of the prize is that I get to travel to Kenya later this year (along with the 2 other winners) to help build, prototype, and test an application from within a refugee camp. I&#8217;m really looking forward to the opportunity to help more refugees get connected with long lost family members.

Here&#8217;s a link to the [press release][3], and here&#8217;s how our project turned out:
