I've seen this question appear in places like <a href="http://zurb.com/tavern">Tavern</a>, <a href="https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-difference-between-a-product-manager-and-a-product-designer">Quora</a>, and I've also been asked by designers new to the field how all the various job titles interact with one another. Where do they overlap, what skills are different, what's the difference between an interaction and UX designer, and so on. I want to weigh in on this confusing question to attempt to bring some clarity to the matter.

### Design is the layer between customer and business

All designers are working on the same thing: to make the experience of a product, service, or marketing message the best that it can possibly be. The experience is the layer — the glue, if you will — between the customer and the apparatus created by engineers and business people. The boundaries of this experience encompass everything from marketing communication to the experience of using an API and searching through documentation.

The way designers describe what they do is impossible to understand outside the context of the product they're producing and the audience they're producing it for. A product designer who designs medical devices for the elderly will have an entirely different skillset than a product designer for a consumer ride-sharing startup.

## Understanding job titles

One of the easiest ways to make some sense of the field of job titles is to draw a line between the *specialized* disciplines and the *generalist* disciplines, and then understand what these disciplines mean in the context of the customer you're serving and the company environment you're working in.

1. *Specialized Designers* — Those who focus on a particular point in time or a specific aspect of the design (such as a visual designer, who might only work on UI polish, or an interaction designer who will zoom in on the nitty gritty of how users interact with controls). They may work across a product lifecycle, but will generally be focused on a single aspect of it. Specialists thrive on larger teams who can oversee the disciplines the specialist doesn't cover.
2. *Generalist Designers* — Those who generalize and see a product through a wider chunk of its lifecycle (such as a product designer or entrepreneur who will design a product from idea all the way through implementation). They tend to be more holistic in their thinking, often pulling in techniques and findings from unrelated fields to enhance their design. They tend to thrive in younger companies where specialization is a liability rather than an asset.


### All designers are user experience designers

_All_ designers in any capacity are user experience designers. Since all designers work along the customer-facing spectrum, all designers have the capacity to affect the experience <a href="/ten-million-smiles/">positively or negatively</a>.

Within that umbrella, however, the specialists and generalists break down more like this:

* Design &amp; User Experience
  * Specialized Designers
    * Interaction designers
    * Visual designers
    * UI designers
    * _and so on&hellip;_
  * Generalist Designers
    * Digital product designers
    * Physical product designers
    * Certain interaction designers
    * _and so on&hellip;_

## How to pick the right design specialty for you

When most people ask about job titles, they want to know not only what the work looks like, but also what kind of jobs might be available if they pursue the path.

Though this is just one person's advice, this is the best method I've found for reasoning through this problem.

If you answer the following two questions honestly and accurately, you'll be pretty close to narrowing down an ideal specialty:

1. <a href="#who-do-you-want-to-serve">Who do you want to serve with your design work?</a>
2. <a href="#what-kind-of-company-environment-do-you-want-to-work-in">What kind of environment do you want to work in?</a>

## Who do you want to serve?

When I say "serve" in this context, I mean your end-user. Though design is about flexibly and creatively solving problems in unfamiliar problem spaces, having a connection to your end-user goes a long way toward helping you overcome the more uncomfortable aspects of design. For example, humbly accepting your user knows more about their problem than you do, or seeking the opinion of colleagues even if it means showing unpolished work. These are all things that become much easier when you _genuinely care_ about the effect your solution has on your audience.

In broad strokes, here are a few customer categories to consider in the software space (this is not a comprehensive list):

* **B2B customers** — Business customers have very specific needs with very specific budgets, and are eager to pay for the solution that fits their needs the best. Business customers tend to be more accessible, fewer in number, and extremely loyal — as long as you can deliver on a demanding feature list better than your competitors. Common companies for designers in this space are usually online, software-as-a-service based.
* **Consumer market** — Consumer facing software has a different set of requirements, and carries with it the allure of designing for a massive audience. Designing for the broader consumer market means your design decisions may intimately affect the lives of many. Simultaneously, the consumer market tends to be more fickle than business customers, adopting fad products that are here today, gone tomorrow.
* **Specific customer vertical** — Another way to think about who you design for is to pick a specific demographic or vertical you care a lot about. If you're interested in wine, then you might build a great career at an agency that does business with a lot of wineries. If you're more of a social enterprise type, the non-profit world is in serious need of talented designers.

## What kind of company environment do you want to work in?

Different stages of a company's lifecycle carries with it different perks, responsibilities, and downsides.

* **Early Stage / Small Product Companies** — Startups and companies less than ~50 people. Designers in these types of companies tend to need a more generalist skillset, a bouyant spirit, and a willingness to tackle new challenges for which they might be ill-equipped to deal with.
  * *Good for:*
    * **Product & Interaction Designers** — These specialties thrive at small startups whose main, and sometimes _only_ offering, is a single product or experience. These designers relish the opportunity to practice their skills across the entire spectrum and are frequently delivering prototypes that look, behave, and sometimes are coded exactly like the final product.
    * **Visual Designers** — Many visual designers in smaller companies get a wide variety of work, from marketing and communications design to UI and web design. The upside is that you might get the opportunity to design an icon set. The downside is that if you really just want to design icon sets, chances are you'll be too busy with a million other things to focus on what you want.
    * **UX Designers** — UX design as a broad category is a role frequently seen at small companies. Similar to product designers, the UX designer's responsibilities may extend even beyond those of the product designers to also consider the documentation and support process, and may also take on more of the research and customer feedback responsibilities. In a lot of cases, the UX designer may take on product management responsibilities (or the other way around) until the company grows to a certain size.
* **Mid Stage / Larger Product Companies** — Though people will draw the "mid-size" company line anywhere from 50 people to 250 people depending on their experience, the general rule of thumb is that once a company reaches a certain size, designers are encouraged to specialize their skillset. This effect becomes more and more pronounced as company size increases.
  * *Good for:*
    * **User Researchers** — If you are more interested in the research aspect of the design process, you will likely be happier in a larger company that has the budget and wherewithal to conduct proper user research. Smaller companies typically don't have the time, bandwidth, or budget to yield satisfying results.
    * **Visual Designers** — Visual designers in these types of companies have more of a chance to specialize, and frequently have more structure around the design process. The upside is there are layers of managers to both shield you from the whims of management and help you learn, the downside is there are layers of managers.
    * **UI Designers** — Though UI designers thrive at startups, doing UI design at a larger or later stage company affords you the luxury of diving more deeply. For instance, you might <a href="https://medium.com/designing-medium/crafting-link-underlines-on-medium-7c03a9274f9">be able to analyze all the ways you can code a link underline for maximum aesthetic viability</a>, whereas that same behavior would get you thrown overboard at a startup.
    * **UX Designers** — UX designers at larger companies might use similar tools as UX designers at small companies, but they go into significantly greater depth. There is typically more time, rigor, and formal testing that goes into an enterprise-level UX process.
* **Agencies, Studios, and Consultancies** — Agencies are a different animal. Agency designers have to be skilled at _communicating_ about design (more so than their counterparts), as they frequently interface directly with clients. On the one hand, agency life results in a wider variety of projects with less of the drama surrounded with building a product. On the other, many describe it feeling very impersonal, and that they have no connection to the end result other than the paycheck. Most of the design jobs mentioned above can be found in the agency world, and the size rules apply as well. Larger agencies are more likely to work with larger companies, and designers in that world will likely be more encouraged to specialize. Boutique agencies are more likely to work with smaller companies (though not always), but these designers will always be called on to be multi-discplinary.

## Conclusion

To sum this up, there two main questions
