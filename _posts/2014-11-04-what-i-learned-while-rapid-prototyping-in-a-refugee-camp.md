A couple years ago, I participated in the Global Hack for Good for [REFUNITE][1], and got the opportunity to further develop the winning idea in a refugee camp in Kakuma, Kenya last month.

It was an incredible journey. I got to spend a week working with the amazing and talented RefUnite team, and was happy to help them in a small way. The goal was to test out our messaging wizard in an attempt to connect more refugees with loved ones who've been separated by war, famine, and disease.
