A couple years ago, I participated in the Global Hack for Good for <a href="http://www.refunite.org/">REFUNITE</a>, and got the opportunity to further develop the winning idea in a refugee camp in Kakuma, Kenya last month.

It was an incredible journey. I got to spend a week working with the amazing and talented RefUnite team, and was happy to help them in a small way. The goal was to test out our messaging wizard in an attempt to connect more refugees with loved ones who've been separated by war, famine, and disease.

For a more detailed account about the project, <a href="http://refunite.tumblr.com/post/101827475186/what-i-learned-while-rapid-prototyping-in-a">read about my trip on REFUNITE&#8217;s blog</a>.
