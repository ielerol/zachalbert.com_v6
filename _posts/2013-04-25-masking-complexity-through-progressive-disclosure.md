Many of the “less is more” arguments sound great, and the sentiment comes from the right place. However, the reality is that some tools need to provide a lot of functionality in order to really solve a customer’s problem.

In cases where you can’t remove complexity, try masking it. Progressive disclosure gives you the best of both worlds by *showing less*, but *providing more*.

<!-- more -->
<div class="anchor-offset" id="more"></div>
