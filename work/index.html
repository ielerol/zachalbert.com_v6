              I am the owner of independent product design consultancy <a href="http://scouthawk.io">Scout Hawk Product Design Studio</a>, where I have the good fortune to work with tech entrepreneurs who are trying to make the world a better place for everyone.
            </p>
            <p>I also advise a number of companies like <a href="http://broadly.com/">Broadly</a> and <a href="http://www.samahope.org/">SamaHope</a> on product strategy and design.</p>
            
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>I've been a web design since I was young. I used to build HTML websites as a 12 year old with crude paint programs and hand-coded HTML. Fast-forward 18 years and I have the good fortune to still be doing what I love.</p>
            <p>First and foremost, I am a designer. Though I have taken the time to hone my skills as a coder and a user researcher, I still take a creative, people-first approach to problem solving. I love blending disciplines to create experiences that make people smile.</p>
            <p>See my <a href="#">LinkedIn profile</a> for more information.</p>
