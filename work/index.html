                <h1>What I Do</h1>
                <h2>I'm a product designer, frontend developer, and entrepreneur focused on building apps and websites which improve quality of life for the greatest number of people.</h2>

              I am the owner of independent product design consultancy <a href="http://www.scouthawk.com/">Scout Hawk Product Design Studio</a>, where I have the good fortune to build things for entrepreneurs who are trying to make the world a better place for everyone.
            </p>
            <p>I also advise a number of companies like <a href="http://broadly.com/">Broadly</a>, <a href="http://www.samahope.org/">Samahope</a>, and <a href="https://www.archively.com/">Archively</a> on product strategy and design.</p>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>I've been a web designer since I was young. I used to build HTML websites as a 12 year old with crude paint programs and hand-coded HTML. Fast-forward 18 years and I have the good fortune to still be doing what I love &mdash; combining the technical with the creative.</p>
            <p>Primarily, I think like a designer. While I spend an equal amount of time honing my design skills as I do my understanding of coding, user psychology, and business, I still take a creative, people-first approach to problem solving. I love to blend disciplines to create experiences that make people smile, and the capacity to create great experiences is why I love my job.</p>
