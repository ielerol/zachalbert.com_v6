My personal site.

## The Orrery

At the top of my website (http://www.zachalbert.com/#top) is an orrery (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery). If you want to read more about what went into the project, you can check out the blog post (http://www.zachalbert.com/orrery). Additionally, here's the nasa.gov data the code is based on (http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/).

Unfortunately the code to generate the orrery is currently coupled fairly tightly with my website itself, but I plan on moving it to its own repo at some point in the future. The orrery is constructed using SASS mixins, mostly, though this can be done far more efficiently a number of different ways, I'm sure. You can play around with it locally by cloning this repo and running `npm start`.
