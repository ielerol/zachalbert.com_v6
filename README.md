## The Orrery

At the top of my website is an [orrery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery), a long-held fascination of mine. I built it using data from nasa so that the orbital periods for the planets are correct relative to each other. I included some moons (but not all, for performance reasons). The moons are orbiting correctly relative to each other, but are on a different time scale than planetary orbits. If I used the same time scale, most moons would spin so fast they wouldn't be visible or would melt your computer.
